1st project in the Odin Project

06/13/22: Just completed the first project. Main takeaways are as follows:

1) Still working on figuring out the terminal and how the terminal interacts with Git. The commit process is a little scuffed because 
I didn't realize that where you are in the directory at the time of committing actually matters (I thought "." would catch everything)

2) HTML isn't nearly as complicated as I initially made it out to be. Yes I'm saying that after only having dipped my toes in, but
the hardest part of this project wasn't HTML

06/19/22: Updated the homepage of the website with some CSS. Will go back and transform the other pages as time permits.
